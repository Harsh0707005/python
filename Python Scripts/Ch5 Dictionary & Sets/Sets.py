# Sets is a collection of non-repetitive (values doesn't repeat) elements.

# To Create sets:

a = {1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2}
print(a) # Printing 'a'
print(type(a)) # Printing type of 'a'

'''
Note:
'1' is two times in 'a' but when printed it is only one time.
Thus, a sets doesn't repeat its elements.

# Empty Sets
'''
Empty sets are not created as other like:
'''
b = {} 
print(type(b))

'''
If done this then it will become a empty dictionary and not empty set.

# To create empty sets:

c = set()
print(c)
print(type(c))
