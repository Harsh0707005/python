# Pass
'''
'Pass' is a null statement in python.
It instructs to do "nothing".
For Example:
'''

l = [1, 7, 9]
for item in l:
    pass        # Without pass statement the program will throw an error.

print(l[2])

# OR

i = 4

if i<10:
    pass        # Without pass statement the program will throw an error.
else:
    print("i is not less than 10")

print("Apple")

# Also,
 
while i<10:
    pass        # Without pass statement the program will throw an error.

# It can be used anywhere...
