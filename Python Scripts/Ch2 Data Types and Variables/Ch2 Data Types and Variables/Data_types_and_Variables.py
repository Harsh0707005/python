a= "Harsh"

# A string can be written in 3 types

''' The ways are as follows'''

#a= 'Harsh'
#a= "Harsh"
#a= '''Harsh'''

b= 345
c= 3.14
d= True
# d= None

''' Note: Rules for defining variable-
1. A variable name can contain alphabets, digits and underscores.
2. A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore.
3. A variable name can't start with a digit.
4. No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name. For ex: it can't be a 12.
Example of valid variables: harsh, _harsh, _seven, one8 etc.

Note: Python variables are case sensitive.
for ex.
a=5
A=10
print(a)
>>> 5
print (A)
>>> 10
'''

# Printing the variables:
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(d)

'''
There are 5 types of data types in Python:
1. Integers
2. Floating point numbers (it is basically the decimal numbers.)
3. Strings (these is the type of text that is to be directly printed.)
4. Booleans (these are values to be either true or false.)
5. None
'''

# Printing the type of variables
print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
print(type(d))

'''
'type' function is used to print the data type of the 
defined variable.
For ex. 'integer'( class 'int'), 'string'( class 'str'),'float'( class 'float'), 'boolean'( class 'bool') etc.
